# Hackspiration-Algorand-contracts

This project contains the smart contracts for the Hackspiration-Algorand application, built using AlgoKit and Puya (Algorand Python).

## Smart Contracts

### 1. SubSharePool (`subshare_pool`)
The core contract for the application. It manages:
-   **Pool Creation**: Establishing new subscription pools with specific parameters (cost, duration, max members).
-   **Membership**: Users opting in to join a pool.
-   **Deposits**: Members depositing their share of the subscription cost.
-   **Payouts**: Automated payouts to the admin once the total pool amount is collected.
-   **Cycle Management**: Handling renewal timestamps and reforming the pool for the next cycle.

### 2. HelloWorld (`hackspiration_algorand`)
A basic starter contract generated by the template, useful for testing connection and simple interactions.

## Setup
